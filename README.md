# 🎨 AI Story Generator Agent

An automated AI-powered storytelling workflow that brings stories to life through text, images, video, and narration - fully automated from start to finish.

## 🎯 What It Does

This project showcases the intersection of **creative AI** and **intelligent automation** using multiple AI tools connected via **n8n**:

- ✍️ Generates a unique story using **GPT-4o-Mini**
- 🖼️ Creates a corresponding image with **DALL·E 3**
- 🎞️ Produces a video using **Runway API**
- 🎙️ Narrates the story using **Eleven Labs (Text-to-Speech)**

All processes are automated in a single pipeline — from input to final output — with **zero manual steps** required.
